# 🔍 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. It's about discovering structure in data where we don't know the "right answer" beforehand.

## 📚 Main Categories

### 🎯 Clustering
**Goal:** Group similar data points together

### 📉 Dimensionality Reduction
**Goal:** Reduce the number of features while preserving important information

### 🕵️ Association Rules
**Goal:** Find relationships between different features

## 🔄 Algorithm Overview

| Algorithm | Category | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|----------|----------|------|------|
| **K-Means** | Clustering | Customer segmentation | Fast, simple, scalable | Requires predefined K, spherical clusters |
| **Hierarchical** | Clustering | Taxonomy creation | No predefined K, interpretable | Computationally expensive |
| **DBSCAN** | Clustering | Outlier detection | Finds arbitrary shapes, handles noise | Sensitive to parameters |
| **PCA** | Dimensionality Reduction | Data compression | Removes correlation, interpretable | Linear transformations only |
| **t-SNE** | Dimensionality Reduction | Data visualization | Great for visualization | Not for reconstruction |
| **K-Means++** | Clustering | Improved K-Means | Better initialization | Still requires predefined K |

## 🎯 Clustering Algorithms Deep Dive

### K-Means Clustering
**How it works:** Partitions data into K clusters by minimizing within-cluster sum of squares

**When to use:**
- ✅ When you know the approximate number of clusters
- ✅ When clusters are roughly spherical
- ✅ When you need fast, scalable clustering

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Must specify K beforehand
- ❌ Struggles with non-spherical clusters
- ❌ Sensitive to initialization and outliers

### Hierarchical Clustering
**How it works:** Builds a tree of clusters by iteratively merging/splitting

**When to use:**
- ✅ When you want to explore different numbers of clusters
- ✅ When you need a dendrogram for interpretation
- ✅ When clusters have hierarchical structure

**Limitations:**
- ❌ O(n³) time complexity - slow for large datasets
- ❌ Sensitive to noise and outliers
- ❌ Difficult to handle different cluster sizes

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)
**How it works:** Groups together points in high-density regions

**When to use:**
- ✅ When clusters have arbitrary shapes
- ✅ When you need to identify outliers
- ✅ When cluster sizes vary significantly

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Sensitive to hyperparameters (eps, min_samples)
- ❌ Struggles with varying densities
- ❌ High-dimensional data challenges

## 📊 Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**How it works:** Projects data onto lower-dimensional space preserving maximum variance

**When to use:**
- ✅ Data compression and storage
- ✅ Noise reduction
- ✅ Visualization (2D/3D projections)
- ✅ Feature extraction

**Applications:**
- Image compression
- Data preprocessing for ML
- Exploratory data analysis

### t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
**How it works:** Preserves local neighborhood structure in lower dimensions

**When to use:**
- ✅ Data visualization and exploration
- ✅ Cluster visualization
- ✅ Understanding data structure

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Not suitable for data reconstruction
- ❌ Computationally expensive
- ❌ Results can vary between runs
