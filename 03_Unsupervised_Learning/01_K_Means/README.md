# 🎯 K-Means Clustering

K-Means is one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms used for clustering data into K distinct groups. It partitions data into K clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

## 🎯 Core Concept

K-Means aims to partition `n` observations into `k` clusters where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). The algorithm minimizes within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

### Mathematical Objective
```
minimize: Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ Σₓ∈Cᵢ ||x - μᵢ||²
```

Where:
- `k` = number of clusters
- `Cᵢ` = set of points in cluster i
- `μᵢ` = centroid of cluster i
- `||x - μᵢ||²` = squared Euclidean distance

## 🔄 Algorithm Steps

### Standard K-Means Algorithm

1. **Initialize**: Choose K initial centroids randomly
2. **Assignment**: Assign each point to nearest centroid
3. **Update**: Move centroids to center of assigned points
4. **Repeat**: Steps 2-3 until convergence

### Detailed Process
```
1. Choose number of clusters K
2. Initialize K centroids μ₁, μ₂, ..., μₖ randomly
3. Repeat until convergence:
   a. For each point xᵢ:
      - Calculate distance to all centroids
      - Assign to cluster with minimum distance
   b. For each cluster j:
      - Update centroid μⱼ = mean of all points in cluster j
4. Return final centroids and cluster assignments
```

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation

### Distance Metrics
**Euclidean Distance** (most common):
```
d(x, y) = √(Σᵢ(xᵢ - yᵢ)²)
```

**Manhattan Distance**:
```
d(x, y) = Σᵢ|xᵢ - yᵢ|
```

### Centroid Update
For cluster `Cⱼ` with `nⱼ` points:
```
μⱼ = (1/nⱼ) Σₓ∈Cⱼ x
```

### Convergence Criteria
- Centroids don't move significantly
- No points change cluster assignment
- Maximum number of iterations reached
- Objective function improvement below threshold

## ✅ Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Efficiency**: O(n×k×i×d) where n=samples, k=clusters, i=iterations, d=dimensions
- **Scalability**: Works well with large datasets
- **Guaranteed Convergence**: Always converges to a local minimum
- **Versatility**: Works with any number of features
- **Memory Efficient**: Only stores centroids and assignments

## ❌ Disadvantages

- **Choose K**: Must specify number of clusters beforehand
- **Initialization Sensitive**: Different starting points → different results
- **Spherical Assumption**: Assumes clusters are spherical and similar size
- **Outlier Sensitive**: Outliers can significantly affect centroids
- **Local Minima**: Can get stuck in suboptimal solutions
- **Scaling Sensitive**: Features with larger scales dominate

## 🎯 When to Use K-Means

### ✅ Good For:
- **Spherical Clusters**: When clusters are roughly circular/spherical
- **Similar Cluster Sizes**: When clusters have similar number of points
- **Known K**: When you have domain knowledge about number of clusters
- **Large Datasets**: Efficient for big data
- **Preprocessing**: As a feature engineering step
- **Quick Insights**: Fast clustering for initial data exploration

### ❌ Avoid When:
- **Arbitrary Shapes**: Non-spherical clusters (use DBSCAN)
- **Different Densities**: Clusters with very different densities
- **Unknown K**: No prior knowledge about cluster count
- **High Noise**: Data with many outliers
- **Different Sizes**: Clusters with vastly different sizes

## 📊 Choosing the Number of Clusters (K)

### 1. Elbow Method
Plot WCSS vs. number of clusters K:
```
WCSS = Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ Σₓ∈Cᵢ ||x - μᵢ||²
```
- Look for "elbow" point where WCSS reduction slows
- Subjective interpretation

### 2. Silhouette Analysis
```
Silhouette Score = (b - a) / max(a, b)
```
Where:
- `a` = average distance to points in same cluster
- `b` = average distance to points in nearest cluster

- **Range**: -1 to 1
- **Higher is better**: Values closer to 1 indicate well-separated clusters

### 3. Gap Statistic
Compares WCSS to expected WCSS under null reference distribution:
```
Gap(k) = E[log(WCSS)] - log(WCSS)
```
- Choose K where gap is largest

### 4. Domain Knowledge
- Business requirements
- Interpretability needs
- Practical constraints

## 🔧 Variants and Improvements

### K-Means++
**Problem**: Random initialization can lead to poor results
**Solution**: Smart initialization that spreads initial centroids

**Algorithm**:
1. Choose first centroid randomly
2. For each subsequent centroid:
   - Choose point with probability proportional to squared distance to nearest existing centroid
3. Proceed with standard K-Means

### Mini-Batch K-Means
**Problem**: Standard K-Means slow for very large datasets
**Solution**: Use random samples (mini-batches) for updates

**Benefits**:
- Faster convergence
- Lower memory usage
- Slight loss in cluster quality

### K-Medoids (PAM)
**Problem**: Centroids may not be actual data points
**Solution**: Use actual data points as cluster centers (medoids)

**Benefits**:
- More robust to outliers
- Medoids are interpretable
- Works with any distance metric

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

### Internal Metrics (No Ground Truth)
| Metric | Formula | Range | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|-------|----------------|
| **WCSS** | Σᵢ Σₓ∈Cᵢ \\|x - μᵢ\\|² | [0, ∞) | Lower is better |
| **Silhouette** | (b-a)/max(a,b) | [-1, 1] | Higher is better |
| **Calinski-Harabasz** | (Between SS / Within SS) × ((n-k)/(k-1)) | [0, ∞) | Higher is better |
| **Davies-Bouldin** | (1/k) Σᵢ maxⱼ≠ᵢ ((σᵢ+σⱼ)/d(μᵢ,μⱼ)) | [0, ∞) | Lower is better |

### External Metrics (With Ground Truth)
| Metric | Range | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Adjusted Rand Index** | [-1, 1] | Higher is better |
| **Normalized Mutual Information** | [0, 1] | Higher is better |
| **Homogeneity** | [0, 1] | Higher is better |
| **Completeness** | [0, 1] | Higher is better |

## 🎯 Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
```python
# Load and explore data
# Handle missing values
# Feature scaling (important!)
# Dimensionality reduction (if needed)
```

### 2. Choose K
```python
# Elbow method
# Silhouette analysis
# Domain knowledge
```

### 3. Fit Model
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, init='k-means++', random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
```

### 4. Evaluate and Interpret
```python
# Calculate metrics
# Visualize clusters
# Analyze cluster characteristics
# Business interpretation
```

## 📊 Preprocessing Considerations

### Feature Scaling
**Why Important**: K-Means uses Euclidean distance
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### Dimensionality Reduction
**High Dimensions**: Curse of dimensionality affects distance metrics
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
```

### Categorical Variables
- **One-hot encoding**: Convert to binary variables
- **K-Modes**: Variant of K-Means for categorical data
- **Mixed data**: Use Gower distance
