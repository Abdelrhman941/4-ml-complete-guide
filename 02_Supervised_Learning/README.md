# 🎯 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. This section covers both regression and classification algorithms.

## 📚 Algorithm Overview

| Algorithm | Type | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|----------|------|------|
| **Linear Regression** | Regression | Continuous predictions | Simple, interpretable, fast | Assumes linear relationship |
| **Logistic Regression** | Classification | Binary/multi-class | Probabilistic output, fast | Assumes linear decision boundary |
| **Decision Trees** | Both | Feature importance | Interpretable, handles non-linear | Prone to overfitting |
| **Random Forest** | Both | Robust predictions | Reduces overfitting, feature importance | Less interpretable |
| **SVM** | Both | High-dimensional data | Effective in high dimensions | Slow on large datasets |
| **K-NN** | Both | Simple baseline | No training needed, intuitive | Computationally expensive |
| **Naive Bayes** | Classification | Text classification | Fast, works with small data | Strong independence assumption |
